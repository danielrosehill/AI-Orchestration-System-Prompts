# AI Orchestration System Prompts

This repository contains a number of system prompts for the purpose of creating orchestration agents in an AI assistant network. The repository is divided into various sections containing agents of a similar purpose.

## Overview

AI orchestration involves coordinating multiple AI agents to work together on complex tasks. This repository provides system prompts that can be used to create specialized agents with different roles within an AI network.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into sections based on agent functionality:

- **Core Agents**: Fundamental orchestration agents that manage workflow
- **Specialized Agents**: Agents designed for specific domains or tasks
- **Utility Agents**: Support agents that provide auxiliary functions
- **Integration Agents**: Agents that facilitate communication between different systems

## Assistant Configurations

| Category | Assistant Name | Role | Configuration |
|----------|---------------|------|--------------|
| Route | Orchestration Agent (Daniel) | Routes user requests to the most suitable specialized agent based on documented capabilities | [orchestration-agent-daniel.md](route/orchestration-agent-daniel.md) |
| Route | Orchestration Agent Manager | Manages and optimizes the performance of orchestration agents within a network | [orchestration-agent-manager.md](route/orchestration-agent-manager.md) |
| Categorise | AI Agent Team Organiser | Organizes AI agents into logical teams based on common purposes and functions | [ai-agent-team-organiser.md](categorise/ai-agent-team-organiser.md) |
| Categorise | AI Assistant Organiser | Groups AI assistants into logical clusters based on names, descriptions, and system prompts | [ai-assistant-organiser.md](categorise/ai-assistant-organiser.md) |
| Knowledge | AI Agent Orchestration Assistant (Advisory) | Provides expert guidance on designing and implementing effective multi-agent systems | [ai-agent-orchestration-assistant-advisory.md](knowledge/ai-agent-orchestration-assistant-advisory.md) |
| Network Planners | Assistant Cluster Builder | Analyzes existing AI assistant networks, identifies gaps, and suggests new assistant clusters | [assistant-cluster-builder.md](network-planners/assistant-cluster-builder.md) |

## Usage

Each directory contains system prompts that can be used to initialize and configure AI agents for specific roles in an orchestration network. These prompts define the agent's behavior, capabilities, and interaction patterns.
